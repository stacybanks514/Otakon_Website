###Overview <br>
I've been working at Otakon for over 7 years. And now that I have been studying web development, it is my hope that I can recreate the Otakon website for better user experience of our Con-goers and Staff. 
<br>
Below, I have outlined the user stories, wireframes, technologies used, and other information pertaining to this website.
<br>
###User Stories
User will be able to:
* go to root page, view side scrolling announcements, view lastest news, and 2014 recap
* view and use a fully functional top and bottom navigation bar
* click social media links and be sent to appropriate social media websites for Otakon
* use google maps to get directions to the Baltimore Convention Center
